# NOTE: While brew and cask can install a large number of applications there are still
#       some that need to be installed manually.  I generally install the following apps
#       from the App store:
#           XCode (required before any of the ansible scripts are run)
#           ScreenFlow (even though there is a Cask for this the license is tied to the Apple Store)
#           Todoist (no brew or cask available)
#           Aperature (no cask)
#           Final Cut Pro (no cask)
#           GarageBand (no cask)
#           Logic Pro X (no cask)
#           Motion (no cask)
#           Compressor (no cask)
#           Pages (no cask)
#           Numbers (no cask)
#           Keynote (no cask)
#           Forecast Bar (no cask)
#           PopClip (no cask)
#           Twitter (no cask)
#           Microsoft Remote Desktop (no cask)
#           Shazam (no cask)
#           Pushbullet (no cask)
#           Disk Care (no cask)
#           iPhoto (no cask - not always needed)
